## A Principled Framework for Comparing Variable Importance Measures (VIMs)

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper _“A Principled Framework for Comparing Variable Importance Measures”_. In this work, we address two key questions:

- **What makes a good Variable Importance Measure (VIM)?**
- **How can we compare different VIMs in a principled way?**

### Repository Structure

- `src/` – Code to run all experiments.
- `results/` – Contains:
  - CSV files with experimental results  
  - Code to generate figures  
  - The final figures used in the paper
